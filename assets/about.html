<h2>1. Introduction </h2>
<p>FantastischMemo is a spaced repetation flashcard learning software. It implement a slightly modified Mnemosyne algorithm to maximize the learning efficient. The key features are as follows: 
<ul>
<li> Well tested and highly efficient Mnemosyne algorithm for fast learning</li>
<li> Text-to-Speech feature to aid language learning. Support multiple languages </li>
<li> PC tool is provided to convert Mnemosyne XML, CSV, tab TXT file to the database </li>
<li> A collection of database is provided in Market to try out. </li>
<li> Text format can be changed to fit different database and screen size. </li>
<li> Each flashcard can be edited or deleted on the device. </li>
<li> Simple, easy-to-use and power saving interface. </li>

</ul>
</p>

<h2>2. How to use</h2>
<h3>2.1 Install/Open/Close Databases </h3>
<p> To install a database, you can use the Use the FantastischMemo DB Installer in the market to get a collection of converted database. It will automatically copy db to your sdcard/fantastischmemo directory. Or you can convert the Mnemosyne XML or CSV or Tab(txt) files to anywhere in SD card. 
</p>
<p> To open a database, you just press Open Database and select the .db file in the ugly file browser. You can also open recetently opened database immediately by "Open Recent Database".</p>
<p> To close the program, you can just press the back key or select back from the menu and "Exit" from the main screen. </p>
<h3>2.2 How to memorize the flashcard </h3>
<p>
<h3> Algorithm </h3>
<p> The algorithm is the A* graph search. First the program will expand the root node and put the successors in the fringe. Then it will expand the node that has the least step cost. Before expanding a node, the goal state is checked. Also the repeated state will not be expanded. After the program find out the goal stae, it will trace back to the root using the parent id.</p>

<h2>4. Program Implementation</h2>
<p>The program is written in Javascript that complys with W3C ECMA 1.8 standard. The program design is object-oriented prototype-based programming. The 10puzzle.html will load the start function and the start function will create the Puzzle prototype. The Puzzle prototype has a Solver object.</p>
<h3>Global Prototypes</h3>
<p>Puzzle prototype: This prototype is used to display the UI and the handle the mouse events. It also record the user input state and pass it to the a Solver object.</p>
<p>Solver prototype: This prototype contains the main algorithm and data structure.Start: This is just like a main function.</p>
<h3>Member prototypes</h3>
The code is well-commneted. See the code for details.
